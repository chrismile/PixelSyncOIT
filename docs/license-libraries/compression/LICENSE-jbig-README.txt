The version of libtiff built by MSYS2 and Ubuntu, which is a dependency of SDL2_Image used by this project, is compiled with JBIG-KIT as a dependency.
Unfortunately, JBIG-KIT is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
The authors of JBIG-KIT give permission on their website to link to this library as long as an application software not complying with the
GPL license "makes sure that its users never can actually process JBIG data" (see below).
This is true for this software, as there is no use case where even TIFF files/libtiff would/could ever be used by LineVis or its users.

"Dependency licence: We sometimes receive licence enquiries from people who want to link their proprietary application software with JBIG-KIT solely to satisfy an installation dependency of a precompiled third-party library, but whose application software is designed such that it can never actually use the JBIG encoding. A common example is the libtiff library on Linux: many Linux distributions include that under a BSD-like licence, but commonly compile it such that the GPL-licenced JBIG-KIT package also has to be installed as a prerequisite, to ensure that libtiff loads without dynamic-linking error message. As the author of JBIG-KIT, it is my personal opinion that you only need a licence for JBIG-KIT if you actually intend to use it to encode or decode JBIG data. If your application software makes sure that its users never can actually process JBIG data, in other words if the JBIG-KIT code is not actually reachable in the control flow of your software, then in my opinion you do not need a licence for JBIG-KIT, even if a precompiled JBIG-KIT shipped with the operating system is loaded by the operating system's linker for your application. (Should your lawyers still be worried, you can ask Cambridge Enterprise to issue a properly executed “dependency licence” for a reduced fee.)"
